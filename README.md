# 06-World_Weather_Analysis

## Summary

An app to recommend travel destinations for users based on preferred minimum and maximum temperature. 

Potential travel destinations are created by randomly generating 2,000 coordinates around the world, then confirming cities exist by checking against weather data from the OpenWeather API. 

Users can input their temperature preferences to narrow down the list of potential destinations, hotels are then recommended via Google Places, and itinerary maps are generated via Google Maps.
